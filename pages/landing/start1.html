<p>PulseTile began as an effort to improve the usability of health IT at the clinical frontline
</p>

<p>The effort here is to craft a UX framework along with a reference UI implementation(s) that make life easier at the frontline.
</p>

<p>Take a look at the patterns that underpin our UX framework, our UI kit with its component parts, our showcase demonstrator. 
</p>

<p>Read more to understand our technical choices to date (& under review), our approach to core framework and plugin tiles etc 
</p>

<p>Ask a question or raise an issue on our Github site, we are opening our work to the world.

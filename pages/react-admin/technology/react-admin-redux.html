<h3>Redux</h3>

<h4>Redux general information</h4>
<p>
	<strong>Redux</strong> is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
	It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments
	(client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience,
	such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
	We use redux module for React - <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux">https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux</a>
</p>

<h4>Redux in React-Admin framework</h4>

<p>
    React-Admin framework based on ReactJS and Redux.
    All typical operations for CRUDs (create, read, update, delete) actions are realized by framework: React-Admin creates actions and reducers automatically.
    Developer should only create <a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/DataProviders.html" target="_blank">data provider</a>, which is used for running requests to the server side and parse server responses.
</p>

<p>
    But in some cases it is necessary to run non-typical request to the server side, or to change custom Store parameters.
    In this case React-Admin gives possibility to create custom <a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Admin.html" target="_blank">actions, reducers and sagas</a>.
</p>

<h4>Custom actions in React-Admin</h4>

<p>
    Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.
	They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using [`store.dispatch()`](../api/Store.md#dispatch).
</p>

<p>Here's an example action which represents adding a new todo item:</p>

<pre>
import { createRequestTypes } from "./functions";

export const ADVANCED_SEARCH_ACTION = createRequestTypes('ADVANCED_SEARCH_ACTION', { CREATE: 'CREATE', REMOVE: 'REMOVE' });

export const advancedSearchAction = {
    create: data => ({ type: ADVANCED_SEARCH_ACTION.CREATE, data }),
    remove: data => ({ type: ADVANCED_SEARCH_ACTION.REMOVE, data }),
};
</pre>

<p>
    Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a `type` property that indicates the type of action being performed.
	Types should typically be defined as string constants. Once your app is large enough, you may want to move them into a separate module.
</p>

<p>
    Required actions should be created by the function:
</p>

<pre>
export function createRequestTypes(base, optional) {
    for (let index in optional) {
        optional[index] = base + '_' + index;
    }

    return {
        REQUEST: base + '_REQUEST',
        SUCCESS: base + '_SUCCESS',
        FAILURE: base + '_FAILURE',
        ...optional,
    };
}
</pre>

<p>This makes them portable and easy to test.</p>

<h4>Custom Reducers in React-Admin</h4>

<p>
	Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don't specify how the application's state changes in response.
	This is the job of reducers.
    React-Admin gives possibility to create <a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Admin.html#customreducers" target="_blank">custom reducers</a>:
</p>

<pre>
import { ADVANCED_SEARCH_ACTION } from "../actions/advancedSearchAction";

const initialState = {
    data: false,
};

export default (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case ADVANCED_SEARCH_ACTION.CREATE:
            return {
                ...state,
                data: action.data,
            };
        case ADVANCED_SEARCH_ACTION.REMOVE:
            return {
                ...state,
                data: null,
            };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    All reducers are united in one object in the main reducer file:
</p>

<pre>
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

import currentPatientReducer from "./currentPatientReducer";
import userSearchReducer from "./userSearchReducer";
import advancedSearchReducer from "./advancedSearchReducer";
import clinicalQueryReducer from "./clinicalQueryReducer";
...

const coreReducers = {
    httpErrors: httpErrorReducer,
    userSearch: userSearchReducer,
    advancedSearch: advancedSearchReducer,
    clinicalQuery: clinicalQueryReducer,
    ...
};

export default combineReducers(reducers);
</pre>

<h4>Custom Sagas in React-Admin</h4>

<p>
    If custom action should run requests to the server side, React-Admin gives possibility can use <a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Admin.html#customsagas" target="_blank">custom sagas</a>:
</p>

<pre>
import get from "lodash/get";
import { takeEvery, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import { domainName, token } from "../token";
import { DEMOGRAPHICS_ACTION, demographicsAction } from "../actions/demographicsAction";
import { httpErrorAction } from '../actions/httpErrorAction';

let responseInfo = {};

export default takeEvery(DEMOGRAPHICS_ACTION.REQUEST, function*(action) {
    const url = domainName + '/api/demographics/' + localStorage.getItem('patientId');
    let options = {};
    options.method = "GET";
    if (!options.headers) {
        options.headers = new Headers({ Accept: 'application/json' });
    }
    options.headers = {
        Authorization: "Bearer " + token,
        'X-Requested-With': "XMLHttpRequest",
    };
    try {
        const result = yield fetch(url, options)
            .then(res => {
                responseInfo.status = get(res, 'status', null);
                return res.json()
            })
            .then(res => {
                if (responseInfo.status !== 200) {
                    responseInfo.errorMessage = get(res, 'error', null);
                    return false;
                }
                return res;
            });

        if (responseInfo.status === 200) {
            yield put(demographicsAction.success(result))
        } else {
            yield put(httpErrorAction.save({
                status: responseInfo.status,
                message: responseInfo.errorMessage
            }));
        }

    } catch(e) {
        yield put(demographicsAction.error(e))
    }
});
</pre>

<p>
    All custom sagas are united in a common object in the main sagas file:
</p>

<pre>
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import currentPatientSagas from "./currentPatientSagas";
import initializeSagas from "./initializeSagas";
import demographicsSagas from "./demographicsSagas";
import httpErrorSagas from "./httpErrorSagas";
...
...

const sagas = [
    currentPatientSagas,
    initializeSagas,
    demographicsSagas,
    httpErrorSagas,
    ...
    ...
];

export default function* rootSaga() {
    yield all(sagas);
}
</pre>
